# Figma to Code - Responsive Design Implementation

This project is a direct **translation of a Figma design into functional HTML**, with a strong emphasis on pixel-perfect implementation using **Tailwind CSS**, minimal **JavaScript**, and no front-end framework. It serves as a focused showcase of my ability to take a design file and bring it to life in the browser, faithfully, responsively, and cleanly.

## 🔍 Purpose

The goal of this project is **not** to build a fully functional web app or complex UI system, but rather to **demonstrate my proficiency in translating static design files into clean, semantic code**, staying as true as possible to the original layout, spacing, typography, and overall intent of the design.

## ✨ Key Highlights

* **Figma-to-HTML Implementation**: Every section of the design was built based on the corresponding Figma frame, ensuring layout consistency and visual accuracy.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Used extensively to handle all spacing, sizing, typography, colors, and responsive behavior.
* **Component Thinking (without a framework)**: Although this site is not built with React, Svelte, or similar, I applied a *component-oriented mindset* in structuring reusable markup patterns for clarity and maintainability.
* **Vite for fast development**: Vite was chosen as the build tool to streamline local development and take advantage of its fast HMR and lightweight configuration.
* **Minimal JavaScript**: A small amount of vanilla JavaScript was used for interactivity (if any), keeping the focus on layout and design accuracy.

## 💡 Why No Framework?

This project intentionally avoids using any JS frameworks. While I regularly work with tools like React and Svelte, I chose to focus this project purely on **HTML structure and Tailwind styling**, highlighting fundamentals without the abstraction of a virtual DOM or component library.

The objective was to simulate real-world scenarios where developers are asked to build landing pages, marketing sites, or static prototypes **with exact visual fidelity**, often without needing a JS framework.

## 🧠 My Role & Proficiency

This project reflects my **advanced proficiency (5/5)** in implementing designs from Figma. I have strong experience reading and interpreting design systems, spacing scales, grid layouts, typography, and translating those into performant, accessible front-end code.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* **Vite**
* **JavaScript (vanilla)**

## 📌 Conclusion

This project is a simple but focused exercise in **translating UI designs with precision and care**. It demonstrates my ability to pay attention to detail, work within constraints, and build highly accurate front-end layouts using modern CSS utilities and tooling.
